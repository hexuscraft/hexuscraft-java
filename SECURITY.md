# Security Policy

Hi there - this policy details the procedures for reporting vulnerabilities within our codebase

## Supported Versions

The source code here is updated fairly often, so it is possible older versions already have the vulnerability patched

Please use the latest available source in the [main branch](https://github.com/hexuscraft/hexuscraft-java/tree/main) for testing vulnerabiltiies

## Reporting a Vulnerability

When reporting vulnerabilities, please include as much information as possible so the issue can be quickly rectified

Vulnerabilities can be reported to a developer in our discord server - https://discord.gg/yusJMxrg3e

Look for a user with the "Admin" or "Developer" role and they will be able to assist you from there

## A big thank you

At present, this codebase is primarily maintained by a sole developer - any and all contributions (especially related to finding and patching vulnerabilities) is greatly appreciated
